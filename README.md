All of the labs can be found within. The step-by-step lab files are written in Markdown.

I'll be Demonstrating in several Linux distributions. To best follow along with me I recommend an Ubuntu Server and a CentOS Server, and then some type of Linux client with a desktop (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc). You can find step-by-step instructions and videos about how to install Debian (and other distros) at my website: https://prowse.tech/linux-installs/. And don't forget to subscribe for the latest updates!
