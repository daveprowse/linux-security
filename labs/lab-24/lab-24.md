# Lab 24 - nftables ⚙️

This lab demonstrates how to install and configure nftables on a Debian Server. (Other distros will work in a similar fashion.) Make sure that you can connect to the server from another computer.

For this lab I will be working as root. If you decide to work as a standard Linux user, make sure the user is part of sudoers and issue the `sudo` command before all commands listed below.

> Note: It is recommended that you work directly within the server's console (and not connect via SSH).

## Install nftables

Run the following command:

`apt install nftables`

> Note: It may already be installed in some other distros.

## Start and Enable nftables

Run the following command:

`systemctl --now enable nftables`

Verify that nftables is started and enabled with:

`systemctl status nftables`

You should see results similar to the following:

```console
root@debian12-test:~# systemctl status nftables
● nftables.service - nftables
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nftables.service; enabled; preset: enabled)

```

## Test the Server from a Remote System

From a separate system, try pinging the server and SSH'ing into it. Make sure that you can do so and that no other firewalls or protective software is running on the server.

If you have a firewall conflict, disable the additional firewall. For example:

`systemctl --now disable firewalld`

## Understand nftables Terminology

nftables works off of the **Tables > Chains > Rules** concept which is quite common for firewalls. Remember this as you build your nftables!

Examine the default (insecure) ruleset in nftables:

`nft list ruleset`

You will note that everything inbound and outbound is open.

## Configure nftables

Here we will lock down the server. This is the bulk of the lab. Let's go!

All commands can be run starting with `nft`, but to make things easier, access the nft interactive shell:

`nft -i`

That should put you in the nft prompt:

`nft>_`

> Note: At this point, you can omit `nft` from your commands.

### Build nftables for full security

- Create a new table named "ports_table"

  `add table inet ports_table`

- View the new table

  `list ruleset`

  You should see the new table listed below the original one, similar to the following:

  ```console
  nft> list ruleset
  table inet filter {
          chain input {
                  type filter hook input priority filter; policy accept;
          }

          chain forward {
                  type filter hook forward priority filter; policy accept;
          }

          chain output {
                  type filter hook output priority filter; policy accept;
          }
  }
  table inet ports_table {
  }
  ```

- Create a secure chain called "input"

  `add chain inet ports_table input { type filter hook input priority 0 ; policy drop ; }`

  This will lock down the server. Try pinging or ssh'ing to the server from a remote system. You should not be able to do so.

  > Note: If you were SSH'd into the server you will have lost your connection. That's why I recommend working in the console for this lab.

  At this point, we have a system that cannot be accessed from the outside. In addition, the system cannot make any outbound connections.

### Allow SSH

Let's show how to open a single port (or service) by adding a rule to the ruleset.

- Create a rule that allows SSH

  `add rule inet ports_table input tcp dport 22 accept`

  List the ruleset to see your newly modified table/chain/rule.

  Your nft ruleset should now look similar to the following:

  ```console
  table inet filter {
          chain input {
                  type filter hook input priority filter; policy accept;
          }

          chain forward {
                  type filter hook forward priority filter; policy accept;
          }

          chain output {
                  type filter hook output priority filter; policy accept;
          }
  }
  table inet ports_table {
          chain input {
                  type filter hook input priority filter; policy drop;
                  tcp dport 22 accept
          }
  }
  ```

  > Note, you could also list the service name. For example, you could ave used "ssh" instead of "22".

  Now, you should be able to ssh into the system. Attempt to do so from a remote computer. However, all other types of connections will be dropped.

### Allow ICMP and DNS

Now we'll add a new rule to allow for pinging IP addresss:

```console
add rule inet ports_table input icmp type {echo-request} accept 
add rule inet ports_table input icmp type {echo-reply} accept
```

Test it 

- (From a client) by pinging the server
- (From a server) by pinging the IP address for example.com: 93.184.216.34.

Next, allow pinging by DNS name:

```console
add rule inet ports_table input tcp sport 53 accept 
add rule inet ports_table input udp sport 53 accept
```

Test it by pinging the domain name example.com.

View the entire ruleset: `nft list ruleset`

### Remove a Rule

Find the handle (that is automagically added):

`nft -a list table <table_name>`

or

`nft -a list table inet ports_table` (whatever the name might be)

Then delete the rule:

`nft delete rule <table> <chain> <rule>`

For example:

`nft delete rule inet ports_table input handle 3`

> Note: Don't get rid of the ability to SSH!

> Note: You could remove the entire chain if you wish: `nft delete chain inet ports_table handle 1`

> Note: You could also flush the entire table of all rules (but not chains): `nft flush table inet ports_table`. Or you could modify this with an editor: `vim /etc/nftables.conf`

> **CAREFUL!** To get rid of all rules: `nft flush ruleset`  This removes everything! Including default rules!

## Save the Configuration

This nftables configuration is volatile. To make it persistent, we have to save it.

First, backup the current nftables configuration:

- Exit out of the nft shell by typing `quit`.
- Examine the current nftables configuration:

  `cat /etc/nftables.conf`

  This should show the original configuration with no security.

- Backup the current configuration

  `cp /etc/nftables.conf nftables.conf.bak`

  > IMPORTANT! Don't skip this step! This will now be available to you so you can restore the original configuration later.

- Save the new configuration:

  `nft list ruleset > /etc/nftables.conf`

- Restart the nftables service

  `systemctl restart nftables`

- Reboot the server

- Check the ruleset and verify that it is persistent:

  `nft list ruleset`

- Attempt to ssh into the server. You should still be able to.
  
> Play with it! Learn nftables!

## Restore the Original Configuration

- Copy the backed up original config to /etc:

  `cp nftables.conf.bak /etc/nftables.conf`

- Restart nftables

  `systemctl restart nftables`

- Check that the original configuration is now running:

  `nft list ruleset`

You should see the original (insecure) configuration.
