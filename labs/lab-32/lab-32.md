# Lab 32 - rsyslog ⚙️

Wouldn't it be great to be able to review the logs of many remote servers from the comfort of your main workstaton? Well, rsyslog is the way.

This lab covers:

- How to install rsyslog
- How to configure an rsyslog centralized server
- How to push logs from remote servers to the centralized logging server.

> Note: I'll be working on a Debian client system (the centralized logging server) and a Debian server (the remote server to be logged). I'll be working as root.

## Install rsyslog

`apt install rsyslog`

Now, the `syslog` log file shows up in /var/log (it wasn't there before).

Also, the syslog service is started (can be referred to as syslog or rsyslog).

That should log local information to the file.

Type `rsyslog -d` to see details about rsyslog

## Grab syslogs from Remote Servers

This assumes a workstation (that will gather remote logs) and the servers to be logged.

### On the Workstation

`vim /etc/rsyslog.conf`

Uncomment the UDP and TCP syslog reception lines

Restart the service: `systemctl restart syslog`

Now, the workstation is listening on port 514 (TCP and UDP) for syslog info.

`sudo ss -tulnp | grep "rsyslog"` to see ports open or `ss -ant`

> Note: You may need to open the port on your firewall. 

### On the Server(s) to be Logged

Install rsyslog

`vim /etc/rsyslog.conf`

Find the line: `*.*;auth,authpriv.none		-/var/log/syslog`

Comment it out

Replace with something like: 

`*.* @@10.0.2.52:514`

> Note: or `cron.none,*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none @10.0.2.52:514` for less logged information.

Be sure to specify the correct IP of the Workstation to send syslog messages to.

Restart the service: `systemctl restart syslog`

Reboot the computer to generate logs

> Note: Consider using a different port for security (such as 30514), but remember to open it on firewall and issue `semanage` command on SELinux-based systems.

### Monitor from the Workstation

Now, the remote server's logs should show up in /var/log/syslog along with the local system's logs.

### Setup separate remote log locations for each system

Create a "servers" directory:

`mkdir /var/log/remoteservers`

In `/etc/rsyslog.conf`

Uncomment: `*.*;auth,authpriv.none		-/var/log/syslog`

And add:

```bash
$template RemoteLogs,"/var/log/remoteservers/%HOSTNAME%/%HOSTNAME%-syslog"
*.* ?RemoteLogs
& ~
```

> Note: This also makes a separate directory for the local machine!

> Note: This makes one huge log file. To have separate log files, use `%PROGRAMNAME%.log`. However, this can create a LOT of log files. Be careful!

## Test it

On the remote server

`logger 'test from debserver'`

On the central logging server in /var/log/remoteservers/debserver

check the `root.log` file

The message should be there!

> Note: If you want to have the messages logged locally as well (on any system), simply go to `/etc/rsyslog.conf` and uncomment the line:
> 
> `*.*;auth,authpriv.none		-/var/log/syslog`
>
> Also, on remote systems it is a good idea to create a new .conf file within `/etc/rsyslog.d`

That's it!

👍 **Beyond Awesome!** 👍

syslog isn't just for Linux systems! Consider sending logs from switches, routers, firewalls, and more. Just remember to make sure that port 514 is open on your network.
