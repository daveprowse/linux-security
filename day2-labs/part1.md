Here's the lab material for day 2 of the Linux Networking & Security Fundamentals webinar.

> Note: My main IP network is either: 10.0.2.0/24 or 10.0.42.0/16, depending on the lab being used for the day.

> I run a Debian server and client, Fedora server and client, Ubuntu server, and some mystery Linux distributions. (Really, it's whatever I have available at the time!)

> See [this link](https://prowse.tech/webinars) for more information on how to set up your lab to follow along.
